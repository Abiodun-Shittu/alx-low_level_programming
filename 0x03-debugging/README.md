# 0x03-debugging
This directory contains some certain files on C programming language (Debugging), that will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

## Tasks
### 0. Multiple mains
- Create a file named 0-main.c. This file must test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.

### 1. Like, comment, subscribe
- Copy this main file. Comment out (donâ€™t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.

### 2. 0 > 972?
- Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.

### 3. Leap year
- This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.
-Fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
